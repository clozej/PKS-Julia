# PKS Julia Hackathon

This is a repository for the MPI PKS Julia hackathon.

The tutorial.ipynb notebook contains a showcase of the basic Julia syntax and features.
In the tutorial session, we will go through the notebook step by step and 
provide a more detailed explanation of what each code cell does.

The codesnippets.jl file contains a collection of useful code snippets. 
It is not a fully functional Julia script and is intended only to be used as a reference.
