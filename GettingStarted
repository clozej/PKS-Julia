Detailed platform specific instalation instructions may be found at

I personaly used the jill.py multiplatform installer tool (from section Cross-platform instaler).

After installing you may start the Julia REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) by typing julia on the command line. The Julia REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) is a program that reads and executes Julia code. 

For the tutorial I will be running Julia in VS Code, using jupyter notebooks.
